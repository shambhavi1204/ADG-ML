Regression deals with a predictive modelling technique. It shows the relation between independent also known as predictive variable or dependent or target value.
Logistic regression comes int ouse when output is of categorical format such as yes/no , 1 or 0,true or false, high or low.
As in linear regression we get output values over a large range but for the categorical output it should be between 1 and 0, hence the linear regression curve is to be clipped between 1 and o which is performed using logistic regression , for this we use a sigmoid function.

concept of threshold:
This is used to decide whether the output value(betwwen o and 1) rounds off to give the output as 0(low) or 1(high).
The output values between threshold value(0.5) and 1 is rounded to 1 and the value below threshold and is rounded to 0.

concept of log likelihood:
Using the concept of linear regression:

putting the above value in sigmoid equation:


Now , by taking inspiration from Bernaulli's traits, we find the log likelyhood function and differentiating it to find the gradient ascent update equation. Hence the likelihood is defined as :

log likelihood becomes:

The gradient ascent update equation becomes:

      Straight line graph                                                                 uses sigmoid graph
      
      Uses of logistic regression:
      used for weather forcast such as whether it is clound or ot will rain or not
      multiclass classification
      medical use like diagnosis of various disease.
      
      PROCEDURE:
      
      Import the necessary packages like pandas ,numpy and matplotlib.
      
      Read the data using pandas and display the first ten rows.

      Draw the histogram of independent variables and observe the distribution and analyze the relation between different variable and its impact on the target value.
      
      As the data is present in csv dataframe so to perform operations convert to numpy array and the divide in training and testing data.
      
      using the above mathematical concept and numpy compute the sutable value of variables for which the cost function reduces to a minimum value using gradient descent and then updating the value of parametes after every iteration.
